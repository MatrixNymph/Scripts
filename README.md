This repository will hold all standalone scripts I create.
Some of them will be made for work, some for simple utility.
I work as a penetration tester, so expect a lot of security
related scripts. I don't really care what you do with my 
scripts, as long as you understand that I am not liable
for anything you do with them. Be responsible.
